Opportunities for Enhancement in EVTOL Unit Tests
=================================================

1. Boundary Condition Testing
   - Current tests check basic valid input. Add tests for edge cases:
     - Zero, negative, and very large values for cruise speed, passenger capacity, and ID.
     - Boundary behavior for coinFlip with odds of 0 and 1.

2. Deterministic Behavior Control
   - Introduce a seedable random engine to allow repeatable tests for simulateStep and coinFlip.

3. State Persistence and Transition Validation
   - Extend `testSimulateStep` to validate transitions in charging/fault flags over multiple calls.
   - Track vehicle state before and after simulateStep.

4. Exception and Error Handling
   - Introduce tests that handle or expect failures, such as invalid enum or struct inputs.

5. Performance Benchmarks
   - Add time-bound checks to ensure simulateStep and coinFlip complete within reasonable time under repeated execution.

6. Mocking Randomness
   - Inject a mockable random generator to explicitly control fault/charging triggers in unit tests.

7. Output Validation with Logging Mocks
   - Capture and verify log outputs from `std::cout` or `std::cerr` instead of visual inspection.

8. Code Coverage Expansion
   - Add tests for methods not currently covered if any exist (e.g., new helper methods or internal behaviors).
