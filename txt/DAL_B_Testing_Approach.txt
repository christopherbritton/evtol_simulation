eVTOL Simulation Unit Testing Plan — DO-178C DAL-B Compliance

Overview:
This document outlines the unit testing approach and structural coverage goals for the eVTOL simulation software in alignment with DO-178C Design Assurance Level B (DAL-B).

---

1. Objectives:
- Achieve 100% statement and decision coverage for all safety-critical components.
- Validate key vehicle behaviors, simulation steps, and statistics tracking logic.
- Exercise fault detection, charging behavior, and fleet-level operations.

---

2. Scope of Testing:
Unit tests cover the following modules:
- `AlphaEVTOL`: Constructor and all public accessors, `fly()`, `charge()`, `needsCharge()`, `resetBattery()`, `injectFault()`
- `Statistics`: `update()` and `reset()` methods
- `FleetManager`: `generateFleet()`, `simulate()`, indirect validation of `simulateStep()`
- `StatisticsReporter`: `printStatistics(true/false)` logic tested indirectly through fleet simulation

---

3. Decision Coverage (Key Conditions Tested):
- `vehicle->isCharging()` — true/false
- `vehicle->needsCharge()` — true/false
- `vehicle->checkForFault()` — true (via fault injection)
- `inMinutes` flag for statistics output — true/false

---

4. Test Methods Implemented:
- `testAlphaEVTOL()`
- `testStatisticsUpdateAndReset()`
- `testFleetManagerGenerateAndSimulate()`
- `testForcedFaultInjection()`
- `testSimulateStepWithNoCharging()`
- `testNeedsChargeFalseCondition()`

---

5. Limitations and Declaration:
This test suite focuses on **AlphaEVTOL** as the representative implementation for functional validation.

> The other EVTOL subclasses (Bravo, Charlie, Delta, Echo) are constructed but not individually unit tested. These subclasses are verified through instantiation and runtime simulation in `FleetManager::simulate()`.

---

6. Tools and Compliance Status:
- Manual unit test creation in C++
- Console output validation
- Full decision and statement coverage reviewed and achieved for AlphaEVTOL-related routines
- Remaining subclasses declared as not explicitly unit tested per DAL-B rationale
