Enhancement Opportunities for EVTOL Simulation
=============================================

1. Fleet Behavior Modeling
   - Introduce inter-EVTOL dependencies or interactions to simulate traffic patterns or docking constraints.
   - Simulate dynamic charging queues or charging station failures.

2. Configurable Simulation Parameters
   - Allow runtime configuration of fleet size, time steps, fault rates, and charging speeds via input files or CLI.

3. Visualization and Logging
   - Add visualization output (e.g., fleet charging status over time).
   - Introduce CSV or JSON logging for each simulation step to facilitate analysis.

4. Simulation Granularity
   - Allow for sub-minute simulation steps or variable time-step logic based on EVTOL status.

5. Simulation Duration Control
   - Support dynamic end conditions: e.g., until all EVTOLs have charged at least once or a set number of flights.

6. Vehicle Behavior Enhancements
   - Add additional EVTOL statuses like 'maintenance', 'idle', or 'enroute to charging'.
   - Simulate different fault types and severity levels.

7. Reporting Improvements
   - Expand reporting to include histograms of flight times, charger utilization rates, and idle times.
   - Include per-time-step snapshots of system state.

8. Performance Optimization
   - Use multithreading to simulate large fleets.
   - Use memory-efficient data structures for event queues and fault logs.

9. Integration & Testing
   - Add integration tests that validate multi-class coordination (FleetManager + ChargerManager + FaultManager).
   - Add assertions for invariants (e.g., no EVTOL is in both charging and flying states).

10. GUI (Future Scope)
    - Provide a graphical interface for simulation parameter input and visual output.

11. Multithreading as Simulation Scales
=============================================

1. Parallelizing Simulation Steps for Multiple Vehicles
-------------------------------------------------------
Currently, simulation steps (e.g., simulateStep()) are likely processed sequentially for each EVTOL.
As the fleet grows (e.g., to 1000 vehicles), this becomes a bottleneck.

Benefit:
- Improved throughput and faster step execution across large fleets.

2. Concurrent Charging and Fault Logging
----------------------------------------
Charging logic and fault logging can be offloaded to background threads.


Benefit:
- Parallel processing reduces simulation loop blocking.
- Simulation logic proceeds while logging and analysis run asynchronously.

3. Statistics Collection and Reporting
--------------------------------------
Tracking statistics like flight time, distance, and faults can be done concurrently.

Benefit:
- Enables real-time reporting or logs without slowing down the main simulation.
- Improves responsiveness of dashboards or visualizations.

4. Thread-Safe Components
-------------------------
To support multithreading safely, components must be thread-safe.

Techniques:
- Use mutexes or locks to prevent race conditions.
- Design thread-safe APIs for:
    - StatisticsTracker
    - FaultManager
    - FleetManager

5. Scalability and Hardware Utilization
---------------------------------------
Modern CPUs have multiple cores. Without multithreading, only one is used.

Benefit:
- Fully utilizes hardware potential.
- Enables large-scale or real-time simulations without sacrificing performance.

Caution:
--------
- Multithreading introduces complexity (e.g., race conditions, deadlocks).
- Requires careful testing and debugging discipline.
