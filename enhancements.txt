EVTOL Simulation: Future Enhancements

18. Charging Time Simulation
- Track charge duration and release chargers when full

19. Dynamic Time Step Configuration
- Allow configurable time resolution (30s, 5m, etc.)

20. Battery and Range Modeling
- Simulate energy usage and dynamic flight range

21. Fault Impact and Grounding
- Disable faulty EVTOLs and simulate downtime

22. Route Assignment and Scheduling
- Assign missions and estimate time of arrival

23. Visualization Support
- CSV logging, plotting, and live simulation output

24. Configurable Fleet and Profiles
- Load simulation settings from external config files
